# glibc-update
Script to update CentOS 6.6 to a glibc version that chromedriver likes.

Note : This will get the ChromeDriver to run, but Chrome itself will fail on Centos, which makes this script kind of pointless.  But if you want an updated version of gcc and glibc for something, it will do that.
